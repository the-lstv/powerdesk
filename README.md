## Locked folders (Linux only)
Locked (encrypted) folder management, using [gocryptfs](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs).<br>
Allows to lock and unlock folders using a simple GUI.<br>
This feature is in a very early stage and more of a rough concept.<br>
It is disabled by default - to enable, add a folders.json file inside `/tools/clipboard/` with this structure: `[{ "name": "Examlpe", "path": "/home/user/Pictures/", "color": "blue" }]`.<br>
Folder names for encrypted/plain default to "cipher" and "plain" and can be overriden with the plainFolder and cipherFolder options.<br>

TODO:
- Code quality changes
- Add +, edit, remove, and create buttons
- More auth options
